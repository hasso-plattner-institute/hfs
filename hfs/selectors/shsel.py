        Parameters
        ----------
        hierarchy : np.ndarray
                    The hierarchy graph as an adjacency matrix.
        relevance_metric : str
                    The relevance metric to use in the initial selection

                    information gain and "Correlation". Default is IG.

                    The similarity threshold to use in the initial selection
