SHSEL
======

The SHSEL feature selection method was introduced by Ristoski and Paulheim in 2014 :cite:`ristoski2014feature`.
There are two parts to the algorithm.
The first one is the initial selection. For this part, first, all leaf nodes of the hierarchy tree are identified. Then,
starting from each leaf node the tree is traversed upwards and the relevance similarity value between the current node and
the parent node is calculated. If the similarity is larger than a certain threshold the child node is removed from the feature space.

The second part of the algorithm is the pruning part. Here, all paths from leaf to root node are identified in the hierarchy tree.
Then we calculate the average information gain for each path and remove all features with an information gain lower than this average
value from the feature space. If a feature is on more than one path its information gain only needs to be higher than the average
information gain on at least one of the paths.


This algorithm has two hyperparameters. The first one is the ``similarity_threshold`` that is used in the
initial selection and the second is the ``relevance_metric`` in the initial selection. The relevance metric can be either
correlation or information gain.

HFE
====
The hierarchical feature engineering method (HFE) was proposed by Oudah and Henschel in 2018 :cite:`oudah2018taxonomy` and is an extension
of Ristoski and Paulheim's SHSEL algorithm.  SHSEL is meant for binary features while the HFE method expects numerical
features. Before starting the feature selection algorithm the features are preprocessed by adding the descendants' values
of each node to the own value. These sums are used for the following feature selection algorithm. For the initial selection
part of the SHSEL algorithm correlation is used as the relevance metric. After the pruning part, a third part is added to the
algorithm. From the remaining nodes, we select all leaves of incomplete paths. Incomplete paths are paths that are shorter
than the maximum path. From these leaves, all are removed from the selected features that have a lower information gain score
than the global average or an information gain of 0.

To use the HFE extension, the relevance ``similarity`` parameter of the SHELSelector needs to be set to correlation and the
``use_hfe_extension`` parameter needs to be set to True.
